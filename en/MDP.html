Much of the UX was based on Jakob's Law. There was no time or personnel to develop all elements, so it was necessary to adopt functionalities that had already been tested and refined.

                The use of the Cellular Diagram made the flow of ideas significantly more dynamic. 
                All proposals started to rely on the research as a reference, allowing the creative stage 
                of the process to proceed more smoothly. By translating the research into a visual context, 
                the information became clearer and more enlightening for the course faculty, making the exchange of ideas more practical and efficient.

                The Pedagogical Directional Material (MDP) is an interactive PDF developed to 
                support the practical learning of digital game development, presenting 
                essential concepts of the course in a clear, accessible way and adapted for mobile 
                devices. Created with a focus on student autonomy and ease of use by the teacher, 
                the MDP works as a compact, dynamic, and lightweight guide that can be used without the need 
                for internet, website, or app. Its main objective is to direct learning in a 
                structured and visual way, facilitating the understanding of the processes involved in creating a digital game,
