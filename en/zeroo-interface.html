                    From the project's conception, there was a certainty: some things would become UX debt. With time running and several developers ready for the new system implementation, I had to choose what would be the priority and which screens would be refined later. I chose to focus on the system's main functionality, approximately 40% of the final product, since the remaining 60% depended on it at some point in their flows.

Much of the UX was based on Jakob's Law. There was no time or personnel to develop all elements, so it was necessary to adopt functionalities that had already been tested and refined. Elements and guidelines from Excel, Kayak, Ifood, and other market giants were essential for the conception of assets, grids, and system behaviors.                </text>

            <text class="corpoTextoPost">
                Creating an identity for a brand is always a significant challenge, and in the case of the Zeroo brand, it was no different. Although my role in the company is as a Product Designer, I stepped completely out of my comfort zone to develop an identity that reflected the values and essence of this project, for which I have great appreciation. After several meetings with the Product Owners (POs), we reached a concept that not only represents the pillars of the company but also conveys a welcoming and innovative image of a product that aims to revolutionize the restaurant industry. It was a challenging but extremely rewarding process that resulted in a visual identity aligned with the transformation vision that Zeroo seeks to promote. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The development of the Zeroo brand icon was a careful and detailed process that required attention to both aesthetics and functionality. As the icon would be the visual representation of the brand in such a reduced and frequently used space, it was essential that it be simple, memorable, and aligned with the company's values. The main idea is a stylized "Z" in the shape of a shopping cart.
